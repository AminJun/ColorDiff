# ColorDiff
Colored Character Level Diff between two files. 

For a research project I needed a diff that would throw out differences between two files. 
The default `diff file1.txt file2.txt` works, but it does not color the differences.
I searched over the internet and it seemed that there is no easy way to do it in a single command. 
So I thought I make one and share the code with you. 
If someone knows how to make this available open source for ubuntu/macos, please help me do this.
